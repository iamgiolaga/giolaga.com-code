      title="Fake news based on the induction of fuzzy sets"
      subtitle="Master's degree thesis"
      startDate="Jul 2020"
      endDate="Apr 2021"
      description={`Fake news is a problem that has spread a lot in the last period, in particular with the pandemic.
      The other side of the digitalization is how much easy is today to manipulate information and how web news can go viral. 
      The idea behind this project was to build a system capable to recognize fake news; at the state of art, the tendency is to 
      use mostly classification techniques, that are forced for definition to give drastic response about observations. 
      With the assumption that this kind of approach can be error-prone, my effort was to create a different strategy with the objective of 
      getting a fakeness score: a number between 0 and 1 representing how big is, in webnews, the component of potential fake information. 
      This system is composed by the repeated execution of three steps: 1) Data preprocessing, 2) Model selection, 3) Data visualization. 
      Data preprocessing is the stage where a pipeline of NLP (Nature Language Processing) operations is executed: these operations 
      regard data cleaning, data manipulation, outliers detection, etc; some examples are lowercasing, stemming, lemmatization, tokenization, etc. 
      The final step of data preprocessing is represented by the application of an embedding technique (Word2Vec or Doc2Vec) which 
      allows to convert news from a set of words (strings) to list of floats. 
      Data preprocessing is followed by model selection, the step where the system relies on the algorithm mulearn developed by 
      Professor Malchiodi (UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano). This is a machine learning algorithm taking advantage of a procedure 
      which has been originally formalized in the context of support vector clustering. 
      Mulearn works with an input of numerical values, hence it is well explained the importance of preprocessing data with 
      an embedding step. The entire process is governed by the nested cross-validation technique which outputs a set of possible 
      hyperparameters configuration which can lead to optimal results. Finally there is the data visualization stage where results 
      are analyzed and presented in a descriptive way.`}

      title="Ridge regression for housing prices"
      subtitle="Statistical methods for Machine Learning course"
      startDate="Aug 2020"
      endDate="Oct 2020"
      description={`In the context of Machine Learning, regression represents a supervised approach to infer predictions that
      lay in the numerical domain from a set of heterogeneus information. Labelling data means attaching a value to some observations 
      and this value is the prediction object that is desirable to achieve.
      In supervised learning, labelled data is created to form data sets, and these data sets are used to train a mathematical model.
      A good tradeoff between the number of examples and the model complexity can lead to a good training such that the model is autonomously 
      capable to understand the hidden relationships between observations and labels.
      When data without label is provided, the model tries to do predictions and the results are compared to the actual labels.
      This comparison lets conduct a numerical analysis of how big the error was and what hyperparameters configuration can be chosen
      to minimize it and get the best result.
      Ridge regression is an extension of linear regression that introduces a regularization parameter alpha. The aim of this project 
      was to build a system capable to infer housing prices in the USA from a dataset containing information about its location, its 
      area, its capacity and so on...`}
