## What is this Repository?

This is the repository where you can find the code of [my personal website](https://giolaga.com).
From this repository I launch the command
```
sh autobuild.sh
```
This brief script has the effect of automatically build the application:
a ```build``` folder is generated and its content is then moved to [this repository](https://github.com/iamgiolaga/iamgiolaga.github.io).

To get full automacy you can also use the command
```
sh autopush.sh "this is the name of my commit"
```
to push automatically the latest updates on the two repos.
